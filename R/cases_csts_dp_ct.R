#' 
#' This dataset includes aggregated data on the number of state aid cases per
#' department per year (cross-sectional time-series data) broken down by case
#' type. There is one observation per department per year per case type
#' (1988-2020). The dataset uses current department names.

#' @format A data frame with 8 variables:
#' \describe{
#' \item{key_id}{Numeric. An ID number that uniquely identifies each
#' observation in the dataset. }
#' \item{year}{Numeric. The year the case was opened by the Commission.}
#' \item{department_id}{Numeric. An ID number that uniquely identifies each
#' Directorate-General (DG) of the Commission. There are three DGs that can
